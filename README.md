# All My Exes

All My Exes actually has nothing to do with Texas but regular expressions are fun so what the heck-sas?

## Description

In this exercise you will solve a number of challenges for pattern matching in strings using JavaScript RegExp pattern matching and string replacement.


## Objectives

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub profile and clone to your local machine.

2. Write a function that takes in a string as input and returns true/false if there is a pattern matching 2 numeric numbers and an upper case letter Z in succession anywhere in the string.

2a. Modify the preceding function to replace just the first pattern match with three zeros.

2b. Modify the preceding function to replace all matching patterns with three letter A's.

3. Write a function that takes in an HTML string and replaces any span tags with div tags and returns the resulting string.

4. Write a function that takes in any URL string as input and returns the entire URL received as is with only the domain name replaced with a domain name of your choosing.

5. Copy the source of [www.devleague.com](www.devleague.com) and paste into you Sublime Text editor. Using the RegEx matching tool write a regular expression that matches all element attributes and their values as a single match per attribute.

6. BONUS: Write a function that takes in any URL with 3 query string parameters and returns a URL as a tokenized path using the parameter values. Ex. www.myexample.com?param1=test&param2=me&param3=out => www.myexample.com/test/me/out
